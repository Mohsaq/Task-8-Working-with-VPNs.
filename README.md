# Task 8 – Working with VPNs

## 🎯 Objective
Understand how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) protect privacy, secure communication, and mask IP addresses by using tunneling and encryption.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- ProtonVPN (Free version)  
- Windows 11  
- [WhatIsMyIPAddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) for IP verification  

---

## 🧪 Steps Performed
1. Downloaded and installed **ProtonVPN (Free)** on Windows 11.  
2. Logged in with a free account and opened the VPN client.  
3. Selected a VPN server (Netherlands – Free).  
4. Connected successfully; new **public IP** was displayed.  
5. Verified IP change using [WhatIsMyIPAddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).  
6. Browsed websites (Google, Wikipedia) → confirmed they worked normally.  
7. Disconnected VPN and compared old vs new IP.

## 📊 Observations
- Real IP was masked and replaced with VPN server IP.  
- Browsing worked fine but speed was slightly slower.  
- Some websites showed content as if I was in another country.  
- VPN provided encryption, preventing ISP or attackers from spying on traffic.

## 🛡 How VPNs Protect Security & Privacy
- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted between user and VPN server.  
- **Tunneling**: Traffic is routed securely through a VPN tunnel.  
- **IP Masking**: Hides the user’s real IP address.  
- **Bypassing restrictions**: Can access region-restricted websites.

## ⚠️ Limitations of VPNs
- May reduce **internet speed** due to encryption overhead.  
- Free VPNs may have **data limits** or fewer servers.  
- VPNs do not protect against **phishing** or malware.  
- Privacy depends on VPN provider’s logging policies.

## 📌 Notes
- This task was performed ethically using a free VPN client.  
- Only my own system was used for testing, no unauthorized access was attempted.
